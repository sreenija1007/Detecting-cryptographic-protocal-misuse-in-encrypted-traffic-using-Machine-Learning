# 🔐 IDS for Cryptographic Protocol Misuses

This project implements a machine learning–based intrusion detection system (IDS) to identify misuses of TLS/SSL cryptographic protocols — such as SSL Stripping, downgrade attacks, invalid ciphers, and insecure certificate configurations — using only encrypted traffic metadata.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Detect cryptographic protocol misuses without decrypting packet payloads.
- **Scope:** Focused on TLS handshake features and traffic flow characteristics.
- **Privacy-preserving:** Detection is based entirely on metadata, ensuring no content-level inspection.

## What We Built

- A supervised learning pipeline to classify malicious/misused TLS sessions.
- Feature extraction from **CIC-IDS2017** and **CIC-Darknet2020** datasets.
- Model training with:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
  - **Deep MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron)**

## Features Used

Extracted from encrypted TLS flows:
- TLS Version & Cipher Suite
- Packet Flow Count
- Byte Entropy
- Inter-arrival Time
- Server Name Indication (SNI) presence
- Certificate Validity
- And more...

## Results

| Model         | Accuracy | Micro-F1 | Macro-F1 |
|---------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Random Forest | 96.1%    | 95.4%    | 94.7%    |
| XGBoost       | 97.2%    | 96.8%    | 95.9%    |
| Deep MLP      | 94.3%    | 93.6%    | 92.4%    |


##  Why This Matters

TLS is widely used but often misconfigured. Detecting misuses without decrypting payloads is:
- Scalable
- Non-invasive
- Deployment-friendly in privacy-sensitive systems

This research has potential applications in:
- **Cloud-based IDS tools**
- **Enterprise SOCs**
- **AI-powered security automation**
